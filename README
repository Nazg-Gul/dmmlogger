dmmlogger - logger for the digital multimeters
==============================================

dmmlogger is a simple-to use application to log
readings from your digital multimeter.

It is not ready yet. If you're interested in contributing, see:

  https://github.com/Nazg-Gul/dmmlogger

The short story:

 $ git https://github.com/Nazg-Gul/dmmlogger
 $ make
 $ bin-opt/bin/qt-dmmlogger

Building
--------

Before building, make sure you have the following:

* CMake 2.4 or newer.
* Qt4.

Then run 

 $ make

Supported DMM models
--------------------

Currently only UT-60E multimeter on ttyUSB0 is supported.

Limitation of the port is caused by the lack of configuration
interface and would be solved soon, but other DMM models would
requre the community work since I don't have other multimeters
with the serial interface at this moment.

Supported triggers
------------------

Different triggers are supported by the logger:

* Continous trigger will trigger the logger every time the
  multimeter sends new data to the computer.

* Settle trigger will wait the reading to settle before
  logging the value to the graph.

Currently no configuration interface for this is ready as well.

Problems
--------

If you encounter problems, please mail the branch author.
